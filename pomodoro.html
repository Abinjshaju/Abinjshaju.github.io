  <h2>A Pomodoro Timer Using JavaScript</h2>
  <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Wikipedia</a> "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student."</p>
  <p>
    A Pomodoro Timer Using JavaScript is a project that helps individuals maintain focus, improve productivity, and manage their time effectively.
    
    The Timer implemented using JavaScript allows users to start and stop the timer, reset it to its initial state, and track the progress of their work and breaks. The timer can be customized based on individual preferences, allowing users to set the duration of work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
    
    By utilizing JavaScript, this project provides a practical and interactive way to implement the Pomodoro Technique, enabling users to enhance their productivity and time management skills.</p>
